# ðŸŽ‰ PartyModule
- PartyModule is a way to simplify the creation of a party system in your roblox game.
- You can add/remove players, teleport them to another place (with optional teleport data) and other essentials function you can use!

# ðŸ“˜ Basic Documentation
## Party.new(name: string, players: {[number]: Player}, information: {[any]: any}?) -> Party
- Creates a new party object with a name, players (optional) and information (also optional)

## Party.isPlayerInParty(player: Player, party: Party?) -> boolean
- Checks if a player is in a party.
- Also has an additional party parameter to only check for that party.

## Party:AddPlayer(player: Player)
- Adds a player to the party object.

## Party:RemovePlayer(player: Player)
- Removes a player to the party object. (wow)

## Party:Teleport(placeId: number)
- Teleports all the players inside of the party to a place with its place id.
- Uses SafeTeleport to ensure everyone is teleported regardless of poor network conditions or other errors
- The party is destroyed after this function is called.

## Party:Destroy()
- Destroys the party object, making it unusable.
